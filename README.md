Easy web application powered by Blazor Server framework developed by Microsoft. App has created as a part of project for classes. Following design patterns have been implemeted (or at least tried):
- Adapter - wraps external fake api
- Facade - hides database services implemetation
- Singleton - stores user credentials globally
- State - changes content of object with details info
- Command - invokes buttons press in other place

⚠ IMPORTANT: This is easiest implementation as could be, propably it needs a lot of refactoring and new structure of directories.
❤ THANK YOU: Microsoft for Blazor instead of boring MVC and Razor Pages. Don't screw it up.
✔ RUN: Use Visual Studio, it's the easiest way.
