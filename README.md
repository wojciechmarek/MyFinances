# MyFinances

Simple web application powered by Blazor Server framework developed by Microsoft. App has been created as a part of project for class. Following design patterns have been implemeted (or at least I tried):
- Adapter - wraps external fake api
- Facade - hides database services implemetation
- Singleton - stores user credentials globally
- State - changes content of object with details info
- Command - invokes buttons press in other place

⚠ IMPORTANT: This is the easiest implementation of patterns as could be, propably it needs a lot of refactoring and new structure of directories.<br/>
❤ THANK YOU: Microsoft for Blazor instead of boring MVC and Razor Pages. Don't screw it up.<br/>
✔ RUN: Use Visual Studio, it's the easiest way. Install Net Core 3.1 before, or just the newest version<br/>
